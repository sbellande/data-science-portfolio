# Shammarah Bellande – Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I’m Shammarah! I’m currently transitioning into data science after working in risk strategy and operations. This portfolio is where I document the projects I’ve built while learning Python, SQL, and data analysis—especially as they relate to product decisions, policy evaluation, and the creator economy.

## Featured Projects

### Mock Creator Payout Eligibility Tracker  
A project inspired by Twitch’s monetization policies. I used mock data to simulate which creators would qualify for payouts based on revenue and view thresholds. I applied SQL-style logic in Python using pandas, and visualized payout eligibility trends with matplotlib.

### Netflix Churn Prediction (coming soon)  
Using sample user subscription data to identify cancellation trends. This project will focus on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and possibly a basic predictive model.

### Learning Progress Tracker (ongoing)  
A space where I track concepts I'm practicing, like SQL joins, pandas syntax, data visualization, and causal reasoning. Includes self-directed mini challenges and notes from my learning process.
